# Predicting Medical Expenses Using Multiple Linear Regression

### Content
I was provided with a simulated data set containing hypothetical medical expenses for patients. This data set was created using demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau to approximately reflect real-world conditions. This cross sectional dataset contains 1,338 observations, with each oberservation represeinting one policyholder in the United States. Since this is a simple dataset with a small amount of policyholders, I decided to use this dataset as if it was a propritary dataset used by a start-up medical insurance firm to estimate yearly medical expenses. Therefore the multiple linear regression analysis would be focused on predicting yearly medical expenses from this simple cross-sectional data set.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to answer the following research question: “How can a start-up medical insurance company use the available information collected on each individual policyholder to estimate how much it will have to to pay out in claims on a yearly basis?” 

By answering this question, my goal was to be able to prove that multiple linear regression analysis could be used to predict yearly medical expenses and give decision makers at a start-up medical insurance company useful information about how to make thier business profitable in a risk-filled industry.

### Features
The data set used contains seven different variables:

- Age of the Policyholder

- Sex

- Body Mass Index (BMI)

- Number of Dependants On the policy

- Policyholder's Smoking Habits 

- Region of Inhabitance

- Yearly Medical Expenses

In the linear model created in this project, yearly medical expenses was the dependent variable, while the others were indepenedent variables.

### Structure
This project has six major sections:

(1) Research Question - States the research question being answered in this project and communicates how doing so will be useful in a decision making scenario.

(2) Data Set - Explains where the data set came from, what kind of data it is, what kind of variables it has, and what level of aggregation it is.

(3) Data Exploration - Explored the dataset through summary statistics tables, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, facet wrap plots, frequency & proportion tables, and correlations matrices.

(4) Model Selection - Chose a multiple linear regression model to predict yearly medical expenses, stated the regression equation, and explained the strengths and weaknesses of this model.

(5) Model, Analysis, and Results - Carried out the multiple regression model, displayed and interpreted its results, addressed assumptions made by the model, and acknowledged possible weaknesses.

(6) Conclusion - Concluded the project with an analysis showing how the application of the model would be informative to decision makers and explained how the results of this model would be an effective tool for estimating yearly medical expenses for a start-up medical insurance company.
